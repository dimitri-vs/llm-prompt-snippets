<!-- Original FlashPaste name: Chrome Console Web Scraping -->
<!-- FlashPaste ID: 116 -->

Write a command that can be pasted into the Chrome Developer Tools console to extract specific data from a page's HTML, parse it into a structured table format, and copy the table data to the clipboard for easy pasting into a spreadsheet.

I have provided the HTML on the page that contains the relevant data as a HTML Snippet.

Extracted data should be in a table format with the following headers:
    
- field_1: field extraction instructions
- field_2

<HTML Snippet>
</HTML Snippet>
