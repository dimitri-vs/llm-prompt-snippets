Help me with my database queries/commands.

Feel free to ask me to clarify the purpose of certain fields and let me know if there are additional queries I can run to provide you with a better understanding for how and why things are setup in the DB before you give me advice. When you give me a query add two very concise comments at the top first starting with WHAT:, explaining what it does, the second starting with WHY: explaining why I asked for it or its intent.

I have a database (PostgreSQL 15.4ðŸ”´) that looks something like this:

<generated_ddls>
{{generated_ddls}}
</generated_ddls>

Here is a sample of the data from each table in JSON format:
ðŸ”´get samples with:
SELECT * FROM table_name_here
ORDER BY RANDOM()
LIMIT 4

SELECT * FROM table_name_here
ORDER BY RANDOM()
LIMIT 4
ðŸ”´/end

"""
{{upwork_proposals}}
---
{{user}}
---
{{user_proposal}}
"""

How can I ...ðŸ”´

Please make sure to add a 1-2 sentence comment to the top of the query explaining it.
