# Dimiti's Flashpaste Prompt Snippets

A collection of my most frequently used prompt templates and snippets for working with Large Language Models (LLMs) like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google, as well as for working within Cursor IDE.

## Structure

- `/cursor_ide` - Cursor IDE-specific prompts for code operations, refactoring, and documentation
- `/prompt_modifiers_prefix_suffix` - Modifiers to customize prompt behavior and response formats
  - Prefix modifiers for setting context and tone
  - Suffix modifiers for controlling output format and perspective
- `/misc_dev_helpers` - Development utility prompts for Git, databases, web scraping, and data analysis

## Usage

Each directory contains standalone prompt templates in plain text/markdown format. Templates can be used directly or imported into your preferred snippet management tool.

## Contributing

This is intended as a read-only repository for my prompt snippets, but feel free to fork and use as you see fit.
