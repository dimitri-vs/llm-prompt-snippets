# Dimiti's Flashpaste Prompt Snippets

An export of my most commonly used prompt templates and snippets for working with Large Language Models (LLMs) like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google and working within Cursor IDE.

## Structure

- `/transcripts` - Templates for processing and improving transcribed text
- `/grammar` - Prompts for text clarity and grammar improvement
- `/boilerplate` - Common LLM interaction patterns
- `/extraction` - Text extraction and processing templates

## Usage

Each directory contains standalone prompt templates in plain text/markdown format. Templates can be used directly or imported into your preferred snippet management tool.

## Contributing

This is intended as a read-only repository for my prompt snippets, but feel free to fork and use as you see fit.
