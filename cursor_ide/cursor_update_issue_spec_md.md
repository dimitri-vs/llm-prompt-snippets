<!-- Original FlashPaste name: Cursor: Update ISSUE_SPEC.md -->

Append the @ISSUE_SPEC.mdðŸ”´ file, under **Cursor Implementation Notes**, with two-paragraph summary of our session. If a session exists that is very similar to what we're trying to do and our current sessions scope of changes is minimal, then update the existing session.

1. Add a bold session title that clearly identifies the feature/fix (e.g., "**Manual Content Input Implementation**" or "**Validation Logic Fix**")

2. First paragraph: Describe the original request/goal using "I wanted to..." (focus on technical objectives, root cause if bug fix, and any key investigation findings)

3. Second paragraph: Summarize progress made using "we" (e.g., "We implemented..."), including key technical decisions, important business logic changes, and verification approach. Emphasize completed actions.

Keep it concise. Brevity is preferable over proper grammar.
