<!-- Original FlashPaste name: Cursor: Summarize for New Chat Sess -->
<!-- FlashPaste ID: 187 -->

Generate a summary of our session:  
1. First paragraph: Describe the original request/goal using "I wanted to..." (focus on technical objectives and business logic).  
2. Second paragraph: Dealer's choice - decide whether to provide extra context on what was implemented/changed or continue describing the original request/goal.  
3. Third paragraph: Summarize progress using "We" (e.g., "We implemented..."), emphasizing completed actions and key decisions.  
Keep it concise. Brevity is preferable over proper grammar.
