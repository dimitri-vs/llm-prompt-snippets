This project is [core purpose] built using [key technologies], designed to solve [specific business problem].

The architecture emphasizes [main architectural choices] to achieve [key requirements], though we had to make trade-offs regarding [important decisions, high level business logic].

Be aware of [critical dependencies/integrations] and [known technical debt].

When responding with code edits, include any comments that are nearby the edited code and update them if needed.
If the user has a "TODO:" or "NOTE:" or "IMPORTANT:" comment nearby, **always** include it in your code edit response.
Example: if user's code has `#NOTE: Business logic\n\n\ndef calc():...`, include it as `// ... #NOTE: Business logic {{ updated_code }} // ...`

When asked to do a database migration, write a migration function that can be run in the `main` block unless otherwise specified, including highly visible warnings about irreversible operations and concise safety recommendations for testing and rollback.

Given that tests create a maintenance burden, when I ask you to write tests err on the side of keeping them small, simple and minimal unless I specify otherwise.
