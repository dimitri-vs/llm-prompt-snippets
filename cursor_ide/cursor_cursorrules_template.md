**Cursor Guidelines**

It's very important to preserve and include any nearby comments in the code edits in your responses, updating them as needed.
If the reference code contains or is near "TODO:", "NOTE:", or "IMPORTANT:" comments, always include them in your response code.
Example: Given code with `#NOTE: Business logic\n\n\ndef calc():...`, respond with updated code as `// ... #NOTE: Business logic {{ updated_code }} // ...`

To minimize maintenance burden, when writing tests keep them small, simple and minimal unless specifically requested otherwise.
