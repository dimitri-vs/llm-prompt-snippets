@ðŸ”´git_diff.diff @ README.md
Summarize the diff into a concise commit message of ~40 words or fewer, favoring brevity over proper grammar. Use imperative mood and Conventional Commits format (`<type>[scope]: <description>`). Include scope only if changes are limited to one file or a specific component/module (auth/db/api). Write as a single line, separating multiple items with ";".

Then, looking at the diff, can you infer if there is anything that needs to be updated in the @DEVELOPMENT.mdðŸ”´ file? There might not be, and any additions or changes we should make should be minimal - I don't want to unecessarily bloat this file.
