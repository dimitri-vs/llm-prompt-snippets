<!-- This used as an issue specification and implementation progress tracking document. -->
**Issue Title**: <{Summarize the issue in a concise 15-20 word title. Use sentence case (eg. "This is an example title").}>


## **Initial Context and Goal**

<{Write out a brief overview of the issue in a few sentences (depending on complexity). First, describe the current need or problem, and then state the goals or objectives this issue aims to achieve.}>

## **Initial Issue Specifications**

<!-- Please take a look at the Initial Context and Goal outlined in @ISSUE_SPEC.md and help me write out the Initial Issue Specifications, questions for consideration and Potential Risks and Uncertainties after searching through the codebase to understand the current implementation.ðŸ”´ -->

<!-- Okay, after reviewing your Initial Specs recommendations I updated the ISSUE_SPEC.md to more closely align with existing business logic. Can you again review the relevant code and update my version of the Initial Specifications as needed, but only make highly a small number of highly relevant and key revisions but without settling on too specific of implementation details/options.ðŸ”´ -->

<{Break down the issue into a series of task bullet points, with each being a dense 1 or 2 sentence task description; favoring brevity over grammar. For complex task create sub-tasks, that include additional details necessary for implementation.}>
<{EXAMPLE:

 - [ ] This is a high-level task that needs to be done.
   - ...
   - ...

 - [ ] And this is another high level task

}>

**Questions for Consideration**

<{List any questions that may require further input from the team or need to be addressed before proceeding with the feature.}>

**Potential Risks and Uncertainties**

<{Identify any potential risks or uncertainties associated with implementing this feature request.}>
