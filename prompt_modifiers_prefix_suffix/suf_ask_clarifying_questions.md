Before starting on my inquiry/task, I'd like you to:
1. "Understanding Your Need": Summarize your understanding of my request in one or two sentences.
2. "Clarifying Questions": Ask me three specific questions that would help you better understand my needs and context.
3. "Additional Context Needed": Request any helpful supporting documents or information (e.g., for technical questions: logs, schemas, package versions; for business inquiries: relevant reports, statements; for specific domains: medical records, legal documents, etc.).

Once I respond to some or all of the above, please proceed with addressing my original request.
