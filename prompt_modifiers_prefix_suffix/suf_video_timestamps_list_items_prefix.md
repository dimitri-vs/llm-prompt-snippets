<!-- Original FlashPaste name: SUF: Video Timestamps List Items Prefix -->
<!-- FlashPaste ID: 183 -->

Update the aboveðŸ”´ by prefixing each top level item ðŸ”´ with a timestamp (e.g., `[00:00]`) and bolding the title if its not bold. That is to say I'm looking for something like this: 

"1. **[nn:nn] The Few Word Item Title**: blah blah blah..."

The timestamp should indicate the most relevant point in the Loom video where the discussion of that specific group of details begins. Keep in mind that the order of the items in the list may not match the chronological order of the video/transcript.

If there are two possible starting points for the topic, you can include both of them in the timestamp in this format: `[00:00|00:00]`. If you are uncertain about the relevance or existence of a timestamp for a particular group of details, include a question mark after the timestamp (e.g., `[00:00?]`).
