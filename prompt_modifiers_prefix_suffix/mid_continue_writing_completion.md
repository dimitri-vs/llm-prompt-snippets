Additionally, if there are any ellipsis in brackets (`[...]`), they indicate placeholders for you to completion. Please replace these placeholders with appropriate text, continuing for no more than one sentence. That is to say if the provided text were to say "The President said that [...] he would not be satisfied", in your response could have "The President said that, for as long as this situation continued, he would not be satisfied".
